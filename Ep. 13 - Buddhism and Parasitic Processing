Ep. 13 - Buddhism and Parasitic Processing

The West is in the grip of a problematic way of interpreting Buddhism because it is reduced like many other religions as simply a set of beliefs that need to be understood instead of a system to be enacted. An example is a simple understanding of the four noble truths vs living in a way where they are known deeply as eidos.

He defines suffering as loss of agency and dukkha as self-destructiveness. He goes on to show the crazed mind of someone who walks into a situation that they interpret as negative. It leads to a chain of heuristics, biases, and negative psychological states that looks a lot like papanca. Each of these ways of thought are well adapted behaviors to help us survive, but the collectively act together to create dukkha in our mind.

The process above is called parasitic processing which are spirals of behavior patterns that are present in many different types of behavorial problems and patterns. When these parasitic processess are truly understood, then the four noble truths can start to be enacted vs inertly being able to say the concepts without a deep knowing of them. He closes by explaining the eightfold path is the way to break the chain of parasitic processing from many different entry points.

This was a great way to visualize dukkha!
